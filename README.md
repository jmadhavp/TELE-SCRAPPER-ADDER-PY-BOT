## 🚀 ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION

### Editing config.py
```python
# Change these values:
MAX_ADDS_PER_DAY = 30     # Reduce for safety
MIN_DELAY = 90            # Increase for safety
MAX_DELAY = 240           # Increase for safety
SKIP_NO_USERNAME = True   # Only add users with @username
```

### Using Multiple Accounts
```python
# In each script, change:
SESSION_NAME = 'account1_session'
SESSION_NAME = 'account2_session'
SESSION_NAME = 'account3_session'

# Keeps accounts separate
```

### Custom Filtering
Edit scraper.py to add filters:
```python
# Example: Only users active recently
valid_users = [
    user for user in all_participants 
    if not user.bot 
    and not user.deleted
    and user.username  # Has username
    # Add more conditions here
]
```
